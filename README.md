# *DNASCANNER*

## About this repository
This repository was created as a means of source control for [Ananya Aditi Singh's](https://github.com/AnanyaAditiSingh) and [Desh Iyer's](https://github.com/0xVolt) implementation of the *DNASCANNER* project.

## The Approach
We started by writing a python script named [`sliding-window.py`](sliding-window.py) to illustrate the sliding window technique in Python.
We then scaled this up to the [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) handling a much larger sequence of DNA that we generated using an online tool. This sequence is stored in the text file [`dna.txt`](dna.txt) and is imported as and when required.

In addition, the data structure that stores all of the data pertaining to the nucleotides is written to the [`data.json`](data.json) for future reference.
